**As the code is fresh, it is subject to interface changes and may contain bugs.**

Introduction
---
Mathter is a **C++** matrix library for **game developers** by game developers.
It provides easy to use and fast implementation for **vectors**, **matrices**
and **quaternions**, along with hyperplane and parametric line geometry helpers.

The library's critical parts are SIMD accelerated.

For more information, see [Mathter's wiki](https://github.com/petiaccja/Mathter/wiki).

Installation
---
Add the files from &lt;repo root&gt;/Mathter to your include directory.
No preparation is needed, Mathter is header-only.

A C++14-enabled compiler is required to compile the library. This essentially means to
use MSVC 2015 or 2017. GCC and Clang support will be added soon, but it might compile now as well.
